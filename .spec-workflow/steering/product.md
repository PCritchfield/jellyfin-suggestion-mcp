# Product Overview

## Product Purpose
The Jellyfin MCP Recommendation Server bridges the gap between self-hosted media libraries and AI-driven content discovery. It enables users to have natural conversations with AI assistants about their personal media collection, transforming how people discover and decide what to watch from their own curated libraries.

## Target Users
**Primary Users**:
- **Media Enthusiasts**: Users who maintain personal media servers and want smarter discovery tools
- **AI-First Users**: People who prefer conversational interfaces over traditional search/browse workflows
- **Power Users**: Advanced Jellyfin users seeking to extend their media server capabilities with AI

**Pain Points Addressed**:
- Traditional media browsing requires manual navigation through filters and categories
- Existing recommendation systems don't understand natural language requests
- Users struggle to rediscover content in large personal libraries
- No conversational way to ask "what should I watch based on my mood?"

## Key Features

1. **Natural Language Media Discovery**: Transform conversational requests like "Find me some good 90s comedies under 2 hours" into precise Jellyfin queries
2. **Contextual Recommendations**: Leverage watch history, "Next Up" data, and user preferences for personalized suggestions
3. **Smart Content Analysis**: Provide AI-powered similarity matching with reasoning for "more like this" recommendations
4. **Secure Integration**: Read-only access with token-based authentication and credential management best practices

## Business Objectives
- **Enhance User Experience**: Make personal media libraries more accessible and discoverable through AI
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Establish MCP as a viable protocol for media server integrations
- **Community Growth**: Attract developers to build similar integrations for other media platforms
- **Technical Leadership**: Demonstrate best practices for secure, scalable MCP server implementations

## Success Metrics
- **Functional Quality**: 100% of spec acceptance tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- **User Satisfaction**: 95% of LLM-driven media requests return valid, relevant items in user testing
- **Security Compliance**: 100% enforcement of security policies (kid-mode, result caps, credential redaction)
- **Performance Standards**: < 2s response time for ≤ 24 items on ≤ 20k-item libraries
- **API Stability**: Zero breaking changes without major version bump

## Product Principles

1. **Security First**: Never expose sensitive data like file paths, stream URLs, or authentication tokens by default
2. **Conversational Native**: Design tools that work naturally with AI conversation patterns rather than traditional API paradigms
3. **Read-Only by Design**: Focus on discovery and recommendation without modification capabilities to maintain trust
4. **Spec-Driven Development**: Machine-readable specifications ensure consistency and enable automated testing

## Monitoring & Visibility

- **Dashboard Type**: Development-focused CLI tools and test harnesses
- **Real-time Updates**: Connection testing utilities and authentication verification tools
- **Key Metrics Displayed**: Library size, response times, authentication status, spec compliance
- **Sharing Capabilities**: Example configurations and setup guides for easy deployment

## Future Vision
Position this MCP server as the foundation for a broader ecosystem of AI-enabled media discovery tools.

### Potential Enhancements
- **Multi-Server Support**: Connect to multiple Jellyfin instances for unified library access
- **Advanced Analytics**: Usage patterns, recommendation accuracy tracking, and user behavior insights
- **Collaborative Features**: Shared libraries, family recommendations, and social discovery features
- **Extended Media Sources**: Integration with other self-hosted media platforms (Plex, Emby, etc.)
- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent pre-loading of frequently requested library metadata
