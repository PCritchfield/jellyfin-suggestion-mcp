# Design Document

## Overview

The documentation consolidation will transform the current fragmented structure (README.md, SETUP.md, AUTHENTICATION.md, SECURITY.md, PRD.md) into a unified, comprehensive README.md that serves as the single source of truth for users. This design maintains all essential information while dramatically improving discoverability and reducing maintenance overhead through strategic content organization and progressive disclosure.

## Steering Document Alignment

### Technical Standards (tech.md)
The design follows the documented principle of "Read-Only by Design" by consolidating information without modifying functionality. It aligns with "Conversational Native" design by making documentation more approachable and AI-assistant friendly. The consolidation supports TypeScript development practices by maintaining clear code examples and configuration patterns.

### Project Structure (structure.md)
Following the "Single Responsibility Principle" documented for files, the new README.md will serve as the primary documentation hub. The design maintains "Clear Interfaces" by providing well-defined navigation paths and preserves "Documentation Standards" through consistent formatting and comprehensive coverage.

## Code Reuse Analysis

### Existing Components to Leverage
- **Current README.md Structure**: Overview, quick start patterns, and tool descriptions will be preserved and enhanced
- **SETUP.md Step-by-Step Approach**: Detailed installation procedures will be integrated into expanded setup sections
- **AUTHENTICATION.md Method Documentation**: Both interactive and token-based authentication guides will be consolidated
- **SECURITY.md Best Practices**: Security guidance will be embedded contextually throughout the document

### Integration Points
- **Package.json Scripts**: All existing task references and development workflows remain unchanged
- **Configuration Examples**: All Claude Desktop configurations and environment setups are preserved
- **External Dependencies**: Task runner, NPX installation, and development tool integrations maintained
- **Version Control**: No changes to core project structure, only documentation organization

## Architecture

The consolidated documentation follows a progressive disclosure architecture, organizing information by user journey rather than technical domain. The design uses a hierarchical structure that guides users from initial discovery through advanced configuration and troubleshooting.

### Modular Design Principles
- **Single File Responsibility**: README.md becomes the comprehensive user-facing documentation hub
- **Component Isolation**: Each major section (Quick Start, Setup, Authentication, Security) remains distinct but integrated
- **Service Layer Separation**: Clear delineation between user-facing instructions and technical implementation details
- **Utility Modularity**: Reusable configuration patterns and code examples throughout

## Data Models

### User Journey Flow
```typescript
interface UserJourney {
  entryPoint: 'quick-start' | 'setup' | 'development' | 'troubleshooting'
  userType: 'end-user' | 'developer' | 'contributor'
  authMethod: 'interactive' | 'token-based' | 'undecided'
  setupType: 'npx' | 'local-development' | 'production'
  securityLevel: 'basic' | 'advanced' | 'enterprise'
}
```

### Content Organization Model
```typescript
interface DocumentSection {
  id: string
  title: string
  level: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  // Heading hierarchy
  dependencies: string[]  // Prerequisites from other sections
  audience: UserType[]
  originalSource: 'README' | 'SETUP' | 'AUTHENTICATION' | 'SECURITY' | 'PRD'
  preserved: boolean  // Ensures no content loss during consolidation
}
```

## Error Handling

### Error Scenarios
1. **Missing Prerequisites:** User attempts setup without required dependencies
   - **Handling:** Clear prerequisite checklist with verification commands
   - **User Impact:** Guided resolution with specific error identification

2. **Authentication Failures:** Interactive or token-based authentication issues
   - **Handling:** Comprehensive troubleshooting section with common failure modes
   - **User Impact:** Step-by-step debugging with alternative approaches

3. **Configuration Conflicts:** Multiple authentication methods or environment conflicts
   - **Handling:** Clear decision tree for choosing appropriate authentication method
   - **User Impact:** Guided configuration cleanup and method selection

4. **Connection Issues:** Network, firewall, or Jellyfin server accessibility problems
   - **Handling:** Network diagnostics section with testing commands
   - **User Impact:** Systematic troubleshooting from basic connectivity to advanced network issues

## Testing Strategy
