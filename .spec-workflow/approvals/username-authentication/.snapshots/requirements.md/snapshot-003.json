This feature addresses the limitation that Jellyfin API keys are only available to administrator users, expanding access to non-admin users while maintaining security best practices. This authentication method complements the existing API key authentication without replacing it, offering users multiple secure authentication pathways based on their access level and preferences.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature directly supports multiple objectives outlined in the product steering documents:\n\n- **Enhanced User Experience**: Makes personal media libraries accessible to a broader range of users, including non-admin Jellyfin users who cannot generate API keys\n- **Security First Principle**: Implements secure credential handling without storing sensitive information, following the established security-first approach\n- **Conversational Native Design**: Maintains the existing interactive authentication flow that works naturally with AI conversation patterns\n- **Read-Only by Design**: Continues to focus on discovery and recommendation capabilities while extending authentication options\n\nThe feature addresses a critical gap identified in the technical steering document: \"Authentication Constraints: Jellyfin API keys are only available to admin users, requiring username/password authentication for non-admin users to leverage the MCP server effectively.\"\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Environment Variable Username Authentication\n\n**User Story:** As a non-admin Jellyfin user, I want to configure username/password authentication through environment variables, so that I can set up automated authentication without interactive prompts.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN `JELLYFIN_USERNAME` and `JELLYFIN_PASSWORD` environment variables are provided THEN the system SHALL attempt authentication using these credentials via the `/Users/AuthenticateByName` endpoint\n2. WHEN environment username authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL store the session token and proceed without requiring interactive authentication\n3. WHEN environment username authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure and fallback to interactive authentication prompts\n4. WHEN both API key environment variables (`JELLYFIN_TOKEN`, `JELLYFIN_USER_ID`) and username environment variables are present THEN the system SHALL prioritize API key authentication first\n\n### Requirement 2: MCP Tool for Interactive Username Authentication\n\n**User Story:** As a non-admin Jellyfin user, I want to authenticate interactively using my username and password through an MCP tool, so that I can access my media library recommendations when environment variables are not configured.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN no valid environment authentication is available AND a user calls the `authenticate_user` tool with valid username and password THEN the system SHALL create an authenticated session using the Jellyfin `/Users/AuthenticateByName` endpoint\n2. WHEN interactive authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL store the session token securely in memory and return a success confirmation\n3. WHEN interactive authentication fails due to invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a clear error message without exposing sensitive details\n4. WHEN interactive authentication fails due to network connectivity THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive connection error message\n\n### Requirement 3: Protocol Configuration Support\n\n**User Story:** As a user deploying Jellyfin in different environments, I want to configure the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) through MCP configuration, so that I can connect securely to HTTPS-enabled servers or use HTTP for local development.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the MCP server configuration includes a `protocol` parameter with value `HTTP` or `HTTPS` THEN the system SHALL use the specified protocol for all Jellyfin API communications\n2. WHEN no protocol is specified in the configuration THEN the system SHALL default to HTTP for backward compatibility\n3. WHEN an invalid protocol value is provided THEN the system SHALL return a configuration error with valid options\n4. WHEN the base URL already includes a protocol (http:// or https://) THEN the URL protocol SHALL take precedence over the configuration parameter\n\n### Requirement 4: Session Management Integration\n\n**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my username authentication session to integrate seamlessly with the existing authentication system, so that I can access all MCP tools without repeated authentication prompts.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates via username THEN the session SHALL be managed using the existing `AuthenticationManager` class\n2. WHEN an authenticated user makes subsequent tool calls THEN the system SHALL use the stored session without requiring re-authentication\n3. WHEN a session expires or becomes invalid THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication using the established authentication flow\n4. IF a user has both environment variables (API key) and interactive authentication available THEN the system SHALL prioritize the environment variables as per existing behavior\n\n### Requirement 5: Security and Credential Handling\n\n**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my username and password to be handled securely during authentication, so that my credentials are not stored, logged, or exposed in any system outputs.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a user provides username and password THEN the system SHALL never store these credentials in memory beyond the authentication request\n2. WHEN authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL not log credentials in any debug output or error messages\n3. WHEN the authentication response is returned THEN the system SHALL not expose the access token in any user-visible outputs\n4. WHEN session information is displayed THEN the system SHALL only show non-sensitive information (username, authentication status)\n\n### Requirement 6: Error Handling and User Feedback\n\n**User Story:** As a user experiencing authentication issues, I want clear and helpful error messages, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to resolve authentication problems.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN authentication fails with HTTP 401 THEN the system SHALL return \"Invalid username or password\"\n2. WHEN authentication fails with HTTP 403 THEN the system SHALL return \"User account is disabled or not allowed to sign in\"\n3. WHEN authentication fails due to connection issues THEN the system SHALL return \"Cannot connect to Jellyfin server at [server-url]\"\n4. WHEN an unexpected error occurs THEN the system SHALL return a generic error message without exposing internal system details\n\n### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility\n\n**User Story:** As an existing user with API key authentication, I want the username authentication feature to not interfere with my current setup, so that I can continue using the MCP server without any disruptions.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN environment variables (JELLYFIN_TOKEN, JELLYFIN_USER_ID) are present THEN the system SHALL continue to prioritize API key authentication\n2. WHEN API key validation fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to interactive authentication as it currently does\n3. WHEN a user with admin privileges uses either authentication method THEN both SHALL provide equivalent access to media library tools\n4. IF the username authentication feature is added THEN existing documentation SHALL be updated to reflect both authentication options\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The username authentication functionality should integrate into the existing `AuthenticationManager` class without creating new authentication-specific modules\n- **Modular Design**: Authentication tool should be isolated as a separate MCP tool handler that delegates to the authentication layer\n- **Dependency Management**: No new external dependencies should be required; leverage existing axios, zod, and MCP SDK components\n- **Clear Interfaces**: The `authenticate_user` tool should follow the established MCP tool pattern with proper input validation using Zod schemas\n\n### Performance\n- **Response Time**: Username authentication should complete within 3 seconds under normal network conditions\n- **Memory Usage**: No persistent storage of credentials; session tokens should follow existing memory management patterns\n- **Session Validation**: Existing token validation mechanisms should apply to username-authenticated sessions\n\n### Security\n- **Credential Protection**: Username and password must never be stored beyond the authentication request duration\n- **Session Security**: Username-authenticated sessions must use the same token-based security model as API key sessions\n- **Input Validation**: All authentication inputs must be validated using Zod schemas to prevent injection attacks\n- **Error Handling**: Authentication errors must not leak sensitive information about the Jellyfin server or user accounts\n\n### Reliability\n- **Error Recovery**: Failed authentication attempts should not affect subsequent authentication requests\n- **Session Persistence**: Username-authenticated sessions should persist for the same duration as API key sessions (24 hours)\n- **Graceful Degradation**: Network failures during authentication should return informative error messages\n\n### Usability\n- **Tool Discoverability**: The `authenticate_user` tool should be clearly documented with parameter descriptions\n- **User Feedback**: Authentication success/failure should provide clear, actionable feedback to users\n- **Integration**: Username authentication should work seamlessly within Claude conversations without requiring special setup\n- **Documentation**: Updated authentication guide should clearly explain both authentication methods and when to use each\n",
