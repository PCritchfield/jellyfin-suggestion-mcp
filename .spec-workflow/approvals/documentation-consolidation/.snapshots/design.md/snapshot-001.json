This design maintains all essential information while dramatically improving discoverability and reducing maintenance overhead through strategic content organization and progressive disclosure.\n\n## Steering Document Alignment\n\n### Technical Standards (tech.md)\nThe design follows the documented principle of \"Read-Only by Design\" by consolidating information without modifying functionality. It aligns with \"Conversational Native\" design by making documentation more approachable and AI-assistant friendly. The consolidation supports TypeScript development practices by maintaining clear code examples and configuration patterns.\n\n### Project Structure (structure.md)\nFollowing the \"Single Responsibility Principle\" documented for files, the new README.md will serve as the primary documentation hub. The design maintains \"Clear Interfaces\" by providing well-defined navigation paths and preserves \"Documentation Standards\" through consistent formatting and comprehensive coverage.\n\n## Code Reuse Analysis\n\n### Existing Components to Leverage\n- **Current README.md Structure**: Overview, quick start patterns, and tool descriptions will be preserved and enhanced\n- **SETUP.md Step-by-Step Approach**: Detailed installation procedures will be integrated into expanded setup sections\n- **AUTHENTICATION.md Method Documentation**: Both interactive and token-based authentication guides will be consolidated\n- **SECURITY.md Best Practices**: Security guidance will be embedded contextually throughout the document\n\n### Integration Points\n- **Package.json Scripts**: All existing task references and development workflows remain unchanged\n- **Configuration Examples**: All Claude Desktop configurations and environment setups are preserved\n- **External Dependencies**: Task runner, NPX installation, and development tool integrations maintained\n- **Version Control**: No changes to core project structure, only documentation organization\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe consolidated documentation follows a progressive disclosure architecture, organizing information by user journey rather than technical domain. The design uses a hierarchical structure that guides users from initial discovery through advanced configuration and troubleshooting.\n\n### Modular Design Principles\n- **Single File Responsibility**: README.md becomes the comprehensive user-facing documentation hub\n- **Component Isolation**: Each major section (Quick Start, Setup, Authentication, Security) remains distinct but integrated\n- **Service Layer Separation**: Clear delineation between user-facing instructions and technical implementation details\n- **Utility Modularity**: Reusable configuration patterns and code examples throughout\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[GitHub Landing] --> B[README.md Hub]\n    B --> C[Quick Start -

**Handling:** Clear prerequisite checklist with verification commands\n   - **User Impact:** Guided resolution with specific error identification\n\n2. **Authentication Failures:** Interactive or token-based authentication issues\n   - **Handling:** Comprehensive troubleshooting section with common failure modes\n   - **User Impact:** Step-by-step debugging with alternative approaches\n\n3. **Configuration Conflicts:** Multiple authentication methods or environment conflicts\n   - **Handling:** Clear decision tree for choosing appropriate authentication method\n   - **User Impact:** Guided configuration cleanup and method selection\n\n4. **Connection Issues:** Network, firewall, or Jellyfin server accessibility problems\n   - **Handling:** Network diagnostics section with testing commands\n   - **User Impact:** Systematic troubleshooting from basic connectivity to advanced network issues\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Testing\n- **Content Accuracy:** Verify all consolidated content matches original sources\n- **Link Integrity:** Validate all internal references and external links function correctly\n- **Code Examples:** Test all configuration examples and command-line instructions\n\n### Integration Testing\n- **User Journey Testing:** Follow complete workflows from fresh installation to working configuration\n- **Cross-Platform Validation:** Verify instructions work across different operating systems\n- **Version Compatibility:** Ensure examples work with current package versions\n\n### End-to-End Testing\n- **New User Experience:** Complete setup following only the consolidated README\n- **Migration Testing:** Existing users can transition smoothly without information loss\n- **Troubleshooting Validation:** Common error scenarios have working resolution paths\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Content Inventory and Mapping\n- Catalog all existing content across documentation files\n- Map content to user journeys and identify overlaps/redundancies\n- Preserve critical information in structured format for integration\n\n### Phase 2: Progressive Disclosure Design\n- Design hierarchical information architecture\n- Create clear navigation and internal linking strategy\n- Develop section templates that maintain consistency\n\n### Phase 3: Content Integration and Enhancement\n- Consolidate content following progressive disclosure principles\n- Enhance examples and add missing transition information\n- Integrate security and authentication guidance contextually\n\n### Phase 4: Validation and Refinement\n- Test complete user workflows using only consolidated documentation\n- Validate against all original requirements\n- Refine based on usability and completeness testing\n\n## Backward Compatibility Considerations\n\n### Information Preservation\n- All critical setup information maintained\n- Security guidance preserved and enhanced\n- Authentication methods fully documented\n- Development workflows completely covered\n\n### Reference Migration\n- Internal links updated to point to appropriate sections\n- External references (from other projects) accommodated through clear section anchors\n- Documentation cross-references maintained for ecosystem compatibility\n",
