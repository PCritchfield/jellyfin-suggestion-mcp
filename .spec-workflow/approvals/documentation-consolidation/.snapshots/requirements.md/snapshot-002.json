This feature will consolidate and simplify the existing documentation structure to improve user experience, reduce maintenance overhead, and eliminate information redundancy while maintaining comprehensive coverage of all necessary topics.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature directly supports the product principle of \"Conversational Native\" design by ensuring documentation is approachable and easy to navigate. It aligns with the business objective of \"Community Growth\" by providing clear, unified onboarding that attracts developers to build similar integrations. The consolidation also supports \"Technical Leadership\" by demonstrating best practices for project documentation structure.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Unified User-Facing Documentation\n\n**User Story:** As a developer who wants to use the Jellyfin MCP server, I want a single comprehensive README that covers all essential information, so that I can quickly understand, install, and configure the server without jumping between multiple files.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN a user visits the repository THEN they SHALL see a comprehensive README.md that includes quick start, detailed setup, authentication, and security guidance\n2. WHEN a user needs installation instructions THEN the README SHALL provide both NPX and local development setup paths with clear prerequisites\n3. WHEN a user needs authentication guidance THEN the README SHALL explain both interactive and token-based authentication methods with examples\n4. WHEN a user encounters security concerns THEN the README SHALL include essential security best practices and credential management guidance\n\n### Requirement 2: Streamlined Information Architecture\n\n**User Story:** As a maintainer of the Jellyfin MCP server project, I want consolidated documentation that eliminates redundancy and reduces maintenance burden, so that I can keep information current without updating multiple files.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN maintainers SHALL only need to edit one primary file for user-facing information\n2. WHEN installation procedures change THEN the update SHALL be reflected in a single location\n3. WHEN authentication methods are modified THEN security and setup information SHALL remain synchronized automatically\n4. WHEN new features are added THEN documentation updates SHALL follow a single, clear information hierarchy\n\n### Requirement 3: Preserved Technical Depth\n\n**User Story:** As an advanced user or contributor, I want access to detailed technical information and specialized guidance, so that I can implement advanced configurations and contribute to the project effectively.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN users need comprehensive setup details THEN the documentation SHALL provide step-by-step instructions with troubleshooting guidance\n2. WHEN developers need authentication implementation details THEN the documentation SHALL include both user and programmatic authentication patterns\n3. WHEN contributors need security context THEN the documentation SHALL maintain current security best practices and threat model information\n4. WHEN integrators need API details THEN the documentation SHALL reference the machine-readable specification appropriately\n\n### Requirement 4: Backward Compatibility and Migration\n\n**User Story:** As an existing user of the Jellyfin MCP server, I want existing bookmarks and references to continue working during the documentation transition, so that I don't lose access to information I rely on.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN existing files are consolidated THEN critical information SHALL be preserved in the unified structure\n2. WHEN URLs or file references change THEN the transition SHALL maintain access to essential information\n3. WHEN installation guides are merged THEN all current setup methods SHALL remain documented and functional\n4. WHEN security guidance is consolidated THEN no essential security information SHALL be lost\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The consolidated README.md should serve as the primary user-facing documentation hub\n- **Modular Design**: Maintain clear sections for different user types (quick start, developers, contributors)\n- **Dependency Management**: Reduce interdependencies between documentation files to minimize maintenance complexity\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean navigation and cross-references between remaining specialized documents\n\n### Performance\n- **File Size**: Consolidated README should remain under 15KB for fast loading and readability\n- **Navigation**: Users should be able to find essential information within 3 clicks/scrolls from the main README\n- **Search Optimization**: Content should be structured for effective browser and GitHub search functionality\n\n### Security\n- **Credential Safety**: All security guidance must be preserved and prominently featured in consolidated documentation\n- **Best Practices**: Security recommendations must remain easily discoverable and actionable\n- **Threat Model**: Current security considerations must be maintained in accessible format\n\n### Reliability\n- **Information Accuracy**: All consolidated information must be verified against current implementation\n- **Link Integrity**: All internal and external references must be validated and functional\n- **Version Consistency**: Documentation must align with current package version and dependencies\n\n### Usability\n- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information should be organized from basic to advanced usage patterns\n- **Clear Structure**: Headings and sections should follow logical hierarchy for different user journeys\n- **Code Examples**: All setup and configuration examples should be immediately actionable\n- **Cross-Platform**: Instructions should account for different operating systems and environments\n",
