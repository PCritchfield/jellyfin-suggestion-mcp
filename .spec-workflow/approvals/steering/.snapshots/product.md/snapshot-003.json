It enables users to have natural conversations with AI assistants about their personal media collection, transforming how people discover and decide what to watch from their own curated libraries.\n\n## Target Users\n\n**Primary Users**:\n\n- **Media Enthusiasts**: Users who maintain personal media servers and want smarter discovery tools\n- **AI-First Users**: People who prefer conversational interfaces over traditional search/browse workflows\n- **Power Users**: Advanced Jellyfin users seeking to extend their media server capabilities with AI\n\n**Pain Points Addressed**:\n\n- Traditional media browsing requires manual navigation through filters and categories\n- Existing recommendation systems don't understand natural language requests\n- Users struggle to rediscover content in large personal libraries\n- No conversational way to ask \"what should I watch based on my mood?\"\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Natural Language Media Discovery**: Transform conversational requests like \"Find me some good 90s comedies under 2 hours\" into precise Jellyfin queries\n2. **Contextual Recommendations**: Leverage watch history, \"Next Up\" data, and user preferences for personalized suggestions\n3. **Smart Content Analysis**: Provide AI-powered similarity matching with reasoning for \"more like this\" recommendations\n4. **Secure Integration**: Read-only access with token-based authentication and credential management best practices\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n- **Enhance User Experience**: Make personal media libraries more accessible and discoverable through AI\n- **Ecosystem Integration**: Establish MCP as a viable protocol for media server integrations\n- **Community Growth**: Attract developers to build similar integrations for other media platforms\n- **Technical Leadership**: Demonstrate best practices for secure, scalable MCP server implementations\n- **Documentation Excellence**: Maintain industry-leading documentation that reduces onboarding friction and support burden\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **Functional Quality**: 100% of spec acceptance tests pass in CI/CD pipeline\n- **User Satisfaction**: 95% of LLM-driven media requests return valid, relevant items in user testing\n- **Security Compliance**: 100% enforcement of security policies (kid-mode, result caps, credential redaction)\n- **Performance Standards**: < 2s response time for ≤ 24 items on ≤ 20k-item libraries\n- **API Stability**: Zero breaking changes without major version bump\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **Security First**: Never expose sensitive data like file paths, stream URLs, or authentication tokens by default\n2. **Conversational Native**: Design tools that work naturally with AI conversation patterns rather than traditional API paradigms\n3. **Read-Only by Design**: Focus on discovery and recommendation without modification capabilities to maintain trust\n4. **Spec-Driven Development**: Machine-readable specifications ensure consistency and enable automated testing\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n- **Dashboard Type**: Development-focused CLI tools and test harnesses\n- **Real-time Updates**: Connection testing utilities and authentication verification tools\n- **Key Metrics Displayed**: Library size, response times, authentication status, spec compliance\n- **Sharing Capabilities**: Example configurations and setup guides for easy deployment\n\n## Recent Achievements\n\n### Documentation Consolidation (Completed)\n\n**Objective**: Streamline user experience by consolidating 5 separate documentation files into a single, comprehensive README.md with progressive disclosure architecture.\n\n**Key Results**:\n- ✅ **Unified User Experience**: Single README.md now serves as complete user guide, replacing README.md, SETUP.md, AUTHENTICATION.md, SECURITY.md, and PRD.md\n- ✅ **Progressive Disclosure**: 4-level information architecture (30 sec → 5 min → 15 min → 30+ min) guides users through complexity gradually\n- ✅ **Enhanced Discoverability**: Internal navigation system with table of contents and cross-references enables 3-click access to any information\n- ✅ **Preserved Technical Depth**: All advanced configuration, security guidance, and development procedures maintained with enhanced prominence\n- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Graceful migration strategy with deprecation notices maintains existing user workflows\n\n**Impact**:\n- **Reduced Onboarding Friction**: New users can get started in 5 minutes with clear decision trees for installation paths\n- **Improved Security Awareness**: Security best practices embedded contextually throughout setup workflows\n- **Streamlined Maintenance**: Single source of truth reduces documentation drift and maintenance overhead\n- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Complete development workflow and contribution guidelines consolidated for contributors\n\n## Future Vision\n\nPosition this MCP server as the foundation for a broader ecosystem of AI-enabled media discovery tools.\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n\n- **Multi-Server Support**: Connect to multiple Jellyfin instances for unified library access\n- **Advanced Analytics**: Usage patterns, recommendation accuracy tracking, and user behavior insights\n- **Collaborative Features**: Shared libraries, family recommendations, and social discovery features\n- **Extended Media Sources**: Integration with other self-hosted media platforms (Plex, Emby, etc.)\n- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent pre-loading of frequently requested library metadata\n",
