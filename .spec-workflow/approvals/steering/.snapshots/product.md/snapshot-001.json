It enables users to have natural conversations with AI assistants about their personal media collection, transforming how people discover and decide what to watch from their own curated libraries.\n\n## Target Users\n**Primary Users**:\n- **Media Enthusiasts**: Users who maintain personal media servers and want smarter discovery tools\n- **AI-First Users**: People who prefer conversational interfaces over traditional search/browse workflows\n- **Power Users**: Advanced Jellyfin users seeking to extend their media server capabilities with AI\n\n**Pain Points Addressed**:\n- Traditional media browsing requires manual navigation through filters and categories\n- Existing recommendation systems don't understand natural language requests\n- Users struggle to rediscover content in large personal libraries\n- No conversational way to ask \"what should I watch based on my mood?\"\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **Natural Language Media Discovery**: Transform conversational requests like \"Find me some good 90s comedies under 2 hours\" into precise Jellyfin queries\n2. **Contextual Recommendations**: Leverage watch history, \"Next Up\" data, and user preferences for personalized suggestions  \n3. **Smart Content Analysis**: Provide AI-powered similarity matching with reasoning for \"more like this\" recommendations\n4. **Secure Integration**: Read-only access with token-based authentication and credential management best practices\n\n## Business Objectives\n- **Enhance User Experience**: Make personal media libraries more accessible and discoverable through AI\n- **Ecosystem Integration**: Establish MCP as a viable protocol for media server integrations\n- **Community Growth**: Attract developers to build similar integrations for other media platforms\n- **Technical Leadership**: Demonstrate best practices for secure, scalable MCP server implementations\n\n## Success Metrics\n- **Functional Quality**: 100% of spec acceptance tests pass in CI/CD pipeline\n- **User Satisfaction**: 95% of LLM-driven media requests return valid, relevant items in user testing\n- **Security Compliance**: 100% enforcement of security policies (kid-mode, result caps, credential redaction)\n- **Performance Standards**: < 2s response time for ≤ 24 items on ≤ 20k-item libraries\n- **API Stability**: Zero breaking changes without major version bump\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **Security First**: Never expose sensitive data like file paths, stream URLs, or authentication tokens by default\n2. **Conversational Native**: Design tools that work naturally with AI conversation patterns rather than traditional API paradigms\n3. **Read-Only by Design**: Focus on discovery and recommendation without modification capabilities to maintain trust\n4. **Spec-Driven Development**: Machine-readable specifications ensure consistency and enable automated testing\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n- **Dashboard Type**: Development-focused CLI tools and test harnesses\n- **Real-time Updates**: Connection testing utilities and authentication verification tools\n- **Key Metrics Displayed**: Library size, response times, authentication status, spec compliance\n- **Sharing Capabilities**: Example configurations and setup guides for easy deployment\n\n## Future Vision\nPosition this MCP server as the foundation for a broader ecosystem of AI-enabled media discovery tools.\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n- **Multi-Server Support**: Connect to multiple Jellyfin instances for unified library access\n- **Advanced Analytics**: Usage patterns, recommendation accuracy tracking, and user behavior insights\n- **Collaborative Features**: Shared libraries, family recommendations, and social discovery features\n- **Extended Media Sources**: Integration with other self-hosted media platforms (Plex, Emby, etc.)\n- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent pre-loading of frequently requested library metadata\n",
